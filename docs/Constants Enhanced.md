**Constants Enhanced** instructions are built-in NINA instructions that have been enhanced to allow the use of Expressions.  These instructions take the name of the existing NINA instruction and put a plus-sign (+) at the end.  More instructions will be enhanced in the future.

## Take Exposure +, Take Many Exposures +, and Smart Exposure +

These imaging instructions allow Expressions for number of exposures, exposure time, gain, offset, and dither.  In the examples below, the Constants used are defined elsewhere. *Note: Filter, and binning are planned for the future.*
