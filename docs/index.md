# Welcome to Sequencer Powerups for NINA

The Sequencer Powerups plugin for NINA This plugin contains a variety of useful instructions that enhance the power of the NINA'sAdvanced Sequencer.  The set of these instructions is expected to increase over time; consider them 'utility' instructions.  Many of these instructions allow you to take arbitrary sets of actions when specific circumstances arise; you specify these actions by dragging instructions into place, just as you would to create any instruction set or template.

Among the more powerful Powerups are those related to Constants, Variables, and Expressions.  Complete documentation for these can be found [Here](https://bitbucket.org/zorkmid/nina.plugin.when/downloads/Constants-Variables.rtf)

** NOTE: Sequencer Powerups now supercedes the 'Constants for Exposures' and 'Interrupts' plugins.  Instructions from the deprecated plugins will no longer work if you remove that plugin; you will have to replace them with instructions from here! **

These are the instructions that are current in Sequencer Powerups, broken down by the Category in which they appear in the instruction sidebar.
