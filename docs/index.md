# Welcome

The Sequencer Powerups plugin for NINA contains a variety of useful instructions that enhance the power of the NINA's Advanced Sequencer.  The set of these instructions is expected to increase over time; consider them 'utility' instructions.  Many of these instructions allow you to take arbitrary sets of actions when specific circumstances arise; you specify these actions by dragging instructions into place, just as you would to create any instruction set or template.

** NOTE: Sequencer Powerups now supercedes the 'Constants for Exposures' and 'Interrupts' plugins.  Instructions from the deprecated plugins will no longer work if you remove that plugin; you will have to replace them with instructions from here! **

See the tabs above for current documentation.  This is a work in progress; I hope to have all of Powerups documented by 11/19.

Comments, suggestions, etc. always welcome at the #sequencer-powerups channel on the NINA Discord server.
